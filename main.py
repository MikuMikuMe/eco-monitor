Below is a Python program for a simple smart-home application called `eco-monitor` that tracks energy consumption and provides actionable insights to reduce electricity usage. The program is structured to simulate data collection, data storage, analytics, and user interaction. Please note that this is a basic version to illustrate the conceptâ€”you might want to integrate actual data from smart devices and possibly use machine learning for more advanced insights.

```python
import random
import json
import datetime
from collections import defaultdict

class EcoMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = defaultdict(list)
        self.insights = []

            for appliance in appliances:
                # Simulate energy usage in kWh
                usage = round(random.uniform(0.5, 5.0), 2)
                self.data[appliance].append({
                    "timestamp": datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
                    "usage": usage
                })

            for appliance, total in total_consumption.items():

### Key Points
- **Data Simulation**: Simulated data is generated for various appliances with random energy usage values.
- **Data Storage**: The data is stored in a JSON file for persistence.
- **Data Analysis**: The program provides insights based on total energy consumption per appliance.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is added in each method to handle potential issues, such as file access errors.
- **Menu Interface**: A simple command-line menu interface is provided for interacting with the system.
